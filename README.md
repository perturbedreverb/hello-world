# hello-world
## Update 1
my first GitHub repository

My name is Nate Bucher and I am learning GitHub.
It is pretty confusing right now but I am sure it will get easier as it goes.
I hope to learn how to code and can make a difference in AI and ML.
That is all for now!
## Update 2
Now I am taking a tutorial via YouTube on using Visual Studio Code and GitHub!
This is Fun!
## Update 3
okay starting from a bit back again -- trying to commit again
## Update
last attempt to commit and push before taking a break.
